# cryptoKey

Making encryption as simple as locking the door.

The idea is to have the option to encrypt data in a drop down list on your computer or similar for phone so long as your wristwatch, 
that stores RSA or similar elements, is nearby and paired -

this way if your device is taken your valuable data is not so accessible still.

it may include other features to make life easier - also a watch or wireless way of doing something like this is good so long as the device doesnt get left in the comp - it stays on you
